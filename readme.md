# Prediction Failure Handling Simulation

## Overview

This simulation is part of a master thesis that is concerned with designing and implementing a prediction failure handling component.
The code in this project was primarily used to understand the behaviour of different prediction failure handling approaches. The project contains two runnable scripts.

1. simulation.py: Starts a test run
2. visualization/vis.py: Visualizes the last run based on the logs in **/logs**

## Examples


## Run it
### Dependencies
The simulation uses no dependencies, except numpy and matplotlib. Using pip, both modules can be installed with the following line:

    sudo pip3 install numpy matplotlib

### Configuration
